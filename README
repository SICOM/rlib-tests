Regression tests and examples for RLIB

Licensed under MIT, see the LICENCE file.

This means you can base your own reports on these as examples
without needing to publish them.

To run the tests, first you need to install RLIB from https://github.com/SICOM/rlib

To be able to test the database interactions, you will need to
execute the the database scripts for MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL:

cat src/db-scripts/mysql.sql | mysql -u root
and
psql -f src/db-scripts/postgresql.sql -U postgres postgres

These create the "rlib" user with password "rlib" and the "rlib" database,
then create a "products" table and load it with a few rows.

You better create an ODBC datasource also called "rlib" from either
databases.

Then in this project:

autoreconf -vif -W no-portability
./configure
make
make test
